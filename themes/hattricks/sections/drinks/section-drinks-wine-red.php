        <h4 class="font-bevan font-yellow text-shadow">Underwood Pinot Noir  <span class="menu-price font-white">Glass $6.50<br>Bottle $28.00</span></h4>
        <p class="font-white">
          The 2010 Underwood Pinot noir's limpid, translucent color is more that of a real Burgundy than a New World pinot noir. The mix of black cherry and bramble in the aroma is also convincing, finishing with hints of mulberry and balanced acidity, and no overlay of wood.
        </p>
        <h4 class="font-bevan font-yellow text-shadow">Lange Reserve Pinot Noir  <span class="menu-price font-white">Bottle $55.00</span></h4>
        <p class="font-white">
          A bright garnet hue, this wine expresses notes of strawberry jam, red cherry, black tea, dried rose petal, and a current of flint on the nose. The juicy, mouth-filling palate shows lively red cherry, candied apple, pomegranate, and a hint of Amaretto.
        </p>
        <h4 class="font-bevan font-yellow text-shadow">Kendal Jackson Merlot <span class="menu-price font-white">Glass $7.50<br>Bottle $26.00</span></h4>
        <p class="font-white">
          Intricate layers of black cherry, plum, currant, and wild berry flavors with a hint of spice. The soft, delicate tannins of this Bordeaux varietal carry these aromas and flavors to a long lingering finish.
        </p>
        <h4 class="font-bevan font-yellow text-shadow">Hess Select Cabernet Sauvignon <span class="menu-price font-white">Glass $6.50<br>Bottle $28.00</span></h4>
        <p class="font-white">
          A soft entry, with ripe plum and raspberry in the forefront, is supported by background flavors of tobacco and caramel, which add complexity to this imminently drinkable wine.
        </p>
        <h4 class="font-bevan font-yellow text-shadow">Pine Ridge Cabernet Sauvignon<span class="menu-price font-white">Bottle $75.00</span></h4>
        <p class="font-white">
          A soft entry, with ripe plum and raspberry in the forefront, is supported by background flavors of tobacco and caramel, which add complexity to this imminently drinkable wine.

        <h4 class="font-bevan font-yellow text-shadow">La Crema Pinot Noir <span class="menu-price font-white">Bottle $45.00</span></h4>
        <p class="font-white">
          Earthy aromas meld with juicy ripe plum, punctuated by lovely notes of black tea. The palate echoes the plum-filled nose, joined by black licorice and cocoa powder. A subtle earthiness leads to a generous, fleshy mid-palate and a smooth, mineral-laced finish.
        </p>
        <h4 class="font-bevan font-yellow text-shadow">Burgess Merlot<span class="menu-price font-white">Bottle $32.00</span></h4>
        <p class="font-white">
          The 2007 Merlot, like our previous vintages, demonstrates a unique intense varietal personality along with a richness associated with the vintage. The most common flavor characteristics of merlot, blueberries and black cherries, are stunning with a hint of mint.
        </p>
        <h4 class="font-bevan font-yellow text-shadow">Routestock 29 Cabernet Sauvignon<span class="menu-price font-white">Bottle $39.00</span></h4>
        <p class="font-white">
          The highly aromatic nose showcases a variety of dark fruits with hints of leather, tobacco and violets. On the palate the wine delivers a rush of plum, currant, black cherry and anise, with a subtle oak structure and soft, approachable tannins. Vanilla and kirsch make an appearance in the finish, which is long and complete.
        </p>
        <h4 class="font-bevan font-yellow text-shadow">Groth Cabernet Sauvignon <span class="menu-price font-white">Bottle $85.00</span></h4>
        <p class="font-white">
          From the Groth family's estate vineyards, this has the lush fruit of a classic Oakville cabernet. The structure is lean and firm, with purple and blueberry fruit running straight through it. Sleek mineral tannins keep it tight, revealing a profile that will expand over time in bottle.
